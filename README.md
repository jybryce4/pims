# PIMS 
## Personal Inventory Management System

PIMS is a utility application for managing collections of items in the real world. 
It will be written in Java and will also use OracleSQL 12c as the DBMS.

For example, with PIMS, you can keep track of the number, name, other attributes, etc of cards in your trading card collection. Or:

 - Manage your groceries: save time and money by always having an up to date list of what you have and what you need.

 - Categorize and count your rock collection.

 - Anything related to managing your personal material resources, stock, or collections could benefit.
